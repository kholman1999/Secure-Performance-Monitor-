If you get the entire board the lay out is with the SD card module to the left


|         SD MODULE      |XXX|     GPS     |XXXXX|  I2C  |       BLE           |

|CS|SCK|MOSI|MISO|VCC|GND|X|X|GPS_TX|GPS_RX|X|X|X|SDA|SCL|VCC|GND|BLE_TX|BLE_RX|

Vcc and GND are connected only power one pair.

BLE connections
PD_6/D52 is RX, remember MCU RX -> module TX
PD_5/D53 is TX, MCU TX->RX

GPS connections
DO is RX
D1 is TX
Both are labeled on board, take a look
